# SurveySolutionsAPI

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: stable](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-green.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable)
<!-- badges: end -->

This is the development version of the main [Survey Solutions R API package](https://docs.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/api/api-r-package/). It allows you to export data/paradata collected through CAWI, CATI or CAPI operations, manipulate users and questionnaires, create assignments, get information about the survey progress etc.. All directly out of R. 

However it is more than just a simple wrapper around the Survey Solutions RESTful API, which one can easily address through using i.e. the excellent httr package which also constitutes the basis for this package. The main intention of this package though is to be integrated into your own data collection workflow, either through a shiny application or just through a simple script. This allows you to build your own workflows with your own customized user interfaces for your Survey Solutions data collection operations, no matter if you are dealing with a small scale impact evaluation or a large scale census. 

Important to note here is, that the package also makes extensive use of the *data.table* package, which allows for fast (multi-core) processing of large data sets. The individual functions either return a data.table, or a specific S3 extension of data.table, with individual methods defined. In case you are not familiar with it yet, you should probably have a look a this [introduction](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html).

Specific changes in version 0.6.X:

- Preparation for token authentication (not active yet)
- Map handling and management: suso_mapupload(), suso_mapassign(), suso_mapinfo()
- Introduction of S3 classes for return values, such that all information returned from the API can be used
efficiently. See news for further details and classes.

## Installation

The package is not on CRAN yet, so you have to install it by using

``` r

devtools::install_github("michael-cw/SurveySolutionsAPI", build_vignettes = T)

```

The included vignettes also contain different examples and further explanations. Bellow you can find a few examples. 


## Example

### Credentials Management


To use the API you first need to set-up the API user on your Survey Solutions server. See [here](https://support.mysurvey.solutions/headquarters/api/) for details. After this done, you can use the *suso_set_key()* function, to provide your credentials.


```r
library(SurveySolutionsAPI)
suso_clear_keys()
suso_set_key("https://xxx.mysurvey.solutions", "xxxxxx", "xxxxxxx")
suso_keys()
#> $suso
#> $suso$susoServer
#> [1] "https://xxx.mysurvey.solutions"
#> 
#> $suso$susoUser
#> [1] "xxxxxx"
#> 
#> $suso$susoPass
#> [1] "xxxxxxx"
#> 
#> 
#> attr(,"class")
#> [1] "suso_api"
```


### Workspace Management

You can also manage your workspaces through the API. In particular, you can

- request a list of all workspaces the API user has access to, as well as
- create new workspaces
- and assign users to a particular workspace.

However for the latter two operations you require ADMIN credentials. Standard API user credentials would not work.

To receive a list of workspaces to which the current API user has access to, you can just run:


```r
ws <- suso_getWorkspace()
print(head(ws))
#>       Name       DisplayName DisabledAtUtc
#> 1: primary Default Workspace            NA
#> 2:    test              test            NA
#> 3:   test2             test2            NA
```

### User Management

These functions are particularly useful for survey management, and more details can be found in the corresponding vignette on survey management. Lets start with getting a list of all supervisors on the server.


```r
sv <- suso_getSV(workspace = "test")
print(head(sv))
#>    IsLocked        CreationDate                               UserId   UserName
#> 1:    FALSE 2023-02-07 17:33:40 00d21677-0331-4698-ae7b-908aeac14dd6 somesvuser
#> 2:    FALSE 2023-02-04 19:05:10 ded27a4a-716d-4bf2-8d54-aedc31fc164b     SV0001
#> 3:    FALSE 2023-02-04 19:36:03 5753ddde-3c7d-438f-9934-43fdf18fa802     SV0002
#> 4:    FALSE 2023-02-04 19:36:03 72196c84-8f2f-488a-8d61-f23b8b998d43     SV0003
#> 5:    FALSE 2023-02-04 19:36:03 1a9d4b10-c92d-401d-af69-2a7d0a391fe6     SV0004
#> 6:    FALSE 2023-02-04 19:36:03 97e9e4ff-22e1-492f-a102-03c2115903e7     SV0005
```

### Questionnaire Management

The basic questionnaire API calls are handled through the *suso_getQuestDetails* function.

If no input is provided, the function returns a list of all questionnaires on the server:


```r
questlist <- suso_getQuestDetails(workspace = "test")
# print(questlist)
```

Specifying *operation.type = status*, you receive a list of statuses.


```r
statlist <- suso_getQuestDetails(operation.type = "statuses", workspace = "test")
print(statlist)
#>  [1] "Restored"               "Created"                "SupervisorAssigned"     "InterviewerAssigned"    "RejectedBySupervisor"   "ReadyForInterview"      "SentToCapi"            
#>  [8] "Restarted"              "Completed"              "ApprovedBySupervisor"   "RejectedByHeadquarters" "ApprovedByHeadquarters" "Deleted"
```

By taking a particular *QuestionnaireId* and specifying the *operation.type *you can execute further requests. For example,

### Data Export

To export the data collected in Survey Solutions, you use *suso_export*.


```
#> The last file has been created 0.06833 hours ago.
#> FileName: assignment__actions 
#> Nesting Level: 0 
#> ****
#> 
#> FileName: households 
#> Nesting Level: 1 
#> ****
#> 
#> FileName: interview__actions 
#> Nesting Level: 0 
#> ****
#> 
#> FileName: interview__diagnostics 
#> Nesting Level: 0 
#> ****
#> 
#> FileName: interview__errors 
#> Nesting Level: 0 
#> ****
```

Its return value is a list with the following elememts: main, R1, R2, R3, with

- **main** containing the files: interview__comments, kasai_listing1
- **R1** containing all rosters at the first level
- **R2** containing all rosters at the second level
- **R3** containing all rosters at the third level

through the harmonized ID, main and roster files can easily be put together. More on this in the specific vignette.

## Paradata Export

To retrieve the paradata for a particular interview you use *suso_export_paradata*

```r
system.time(para1 <- suso_export_paradata(questID = questlist[1, QuestionnaireId], workspace = "test", version = questlist[1, Version], reloadTimeDiff = 24, onlyActiveEvents = F, allResponses = T))
#> 
#> The last file has been created 1 hours ago.
#> 
#> Starting download & file extraction. 
#> 
#> 
#> Calculating Response Timings.
#> 
#> Extracting GPS variable.
#> Processing: 
#> 	AnswerSet

#> 	QuestionDeclaredValid
#> 
#> Export & Transformation finished.
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.536   0.036   0.820
```
### Map management

Since recently, it is now also possible, to handle maps through the API. This is implemented through the lately introduced GraphQL API.

To upload a map, you can just use the **suso_mapupload** function like this:


```r
suso_mapupload(workspace = "test", path_to_zip = mapPath)
#>    xMaxVal yMaxVal xMinVal yMinVal wkid             fileName  size maxScale minScale shapeType       importDateUtc                           uploadedBy     users
#> 1:  -78.39    26.8  -78.62   26.55 4326 checkshapesimple.shp 20467        0        0   Polygon 2023-02-16 17:24:47 961d073f-f316-4353-9e7e-1f00899cb837 <list[0]>
```

To assign a map you can use the **suso_mapassign** function:


```r
suso_mapassign(workspace = "test", fileName = "checkshapesimple.shp", userName = "INT0004")
#>                fileName    user shapeType       importDateUtc
#> 1: checkshapesimple.shp INT0004   Polygon 2023-02-16 17:24:47
```

## User Management

User management in the *SurveySolutionsAPI* package relies on two main functions:

- the function to receive all supervisors, **suso_getSV()**
- the function to receive all members for a specific supervisor,  **suso_getINT()**.

These functions allow you to retrieve the required data, to subsequently create assignments, assign or re-assign interviews, maps, workspaces etc.

Besides these two main functions, the package also includes additonal functions to retrieve details on users, retrieve their work history or archive them.

## Create users




## Get table of supervisors


## Get table of interviewers
